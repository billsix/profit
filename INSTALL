INSTALL
=======

This library is managed through the standard autoconf/automake/libtool
build and install routine you should be familiar with.  Options for the
configure script are described below.

To compile the library, execute the following commands:

  ./configure
  make

If you want to build profit from a clean directory, do something like this
instead:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../configure
  make

To install the library (after having compiled it), execute the following
commands:

  make install

That should be all.


PACKAGE SPECIFIC CONFIGURE OPTIONS
==================================

  --with-bigendian=[yes|no|auto]  (default: auto)

	This option can be used to override the endianness detection for the
	target architecture.
