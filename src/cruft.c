 * compiled into the library for binary compatibility reasons.  These
 * functions are no longer declared in the profit header files.
 *
 * For an explanation of the current/revision/age interface versioning
 * system, look up "Versioning" in the Libtool manual.  That is the system
 * being used, except for the fact that we include "old cruft" to be able
 * to keep the age count non-zero even when we remove functions from the
 * interface.
